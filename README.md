# Netflix Tweaks

A Chromium-based browser extension that enhances the Netflix experience by allowing you to control playback speed and skip repetitive segments automatically.

## Features

- Adjust playback speed from 0.5× to 10×
- Automatically skip intros, recaps, and end credits
- Persistent settings: set once, and it stays
- Use hotkeys: `Shift + <` and `Shift + >` to control speed while watching
- Intuitive UI inside the extension menu

## Installation

Since this extension is not available on the Chrome Web Store, you'll need to install it manually:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Extract the contents if it's a `.zip` file.
3. Open your Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome, Brave, Edge).
4. Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
5. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right).
6. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the folder where the extension files are located.

The extension should now appear in your extension bar and be ready to use on Netflix.

## Usage

- Install the extension on any Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome, Brave, Edge).
- Open Netflix and start playing any content.
- Use the extension popup to configure playback speed and skipping behavior.
